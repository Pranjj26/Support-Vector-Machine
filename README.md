# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Project README

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks, using Python and popular data science libraries. In this project, we use the famous Iris dataset to perform classification tasks on three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. SVMs are known for their ability to find the best hyperplane that maximally separates different classes, making them useful for classification problems like this.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (seaborn, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install seaborn pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure

- `SVM_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanations for the SVM classification analysis.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`SVM_Project.ipynb`) using your preferred Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook itself.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell step by step to follow the SVM classification analysis process.
2. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations for each code cell to help you understand the workflow.

## Iris Flower Species Classification

The project involves classifying Iris flower species based on their sepal and petal measurements. It includes the following steps:

- Loading the Iris dataset and visualizing the data using pair plots to understand the distribution of the three species.

## Data Preparation

- Preparing the data for modeling by splitting it into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.

## Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model

- Creating an SVM classifier using `SVC` from scikit-learn.
- Fitting the model to the training data.
- Making predictions using the test data.
- Generating a confusion matrix and classification report to evaluate the SVM model's performance.

## Hyperparameter Tuning

- Fine-tuning the SVM model by finding the best combination of hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV` from scikit-learn.
- Refitting the model with the optimal hyperparameters.
- Making predictions and evaluating the tuned SVM model's performance.
